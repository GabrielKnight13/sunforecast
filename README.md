# Python-Based Solar Activity Predictor
Inspired by Google's solar energy estimator and the codebase available at glassb/solar-forecast, I have explored Python-based program that forecasts solar activity using input solar irradiance data.

The solar activity forecasting code leverages the pvlib Python library to obtain accurate solar irradiance data. This library provides a comprehensive suite of tools for modeling photovoltaic systems, including functions for calculating clear-sky irradiance, solar position, and atmospheric conditions. These features were instrumental in building a reliable and data-driven forecasting model.

The current solar forecasting pipeline leverages a three-year irradiance dataset and integrates both linear regression and Random Forest regressors for predictive modeling.

The pvlib library provides robust capabilities for photovoltaic (PV) system design and analysis. As part of future development, these features will be further explored and integrated to support the goal of building a comprehensive web-based application.
