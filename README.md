# Python-Based Solar Activity Predictor
Inspired by Google's solar energy estimator and the codebase available at glassb/solar-forecast, I have explored Python-based software that forecasts solar activity using input solar irradiance data.

The solar activity forecasting code leverages the pvlib Python library to obtain accurate solar irradiance data. This library provides a comprehensive suite of tools for modeling photovoltaic systems, including functions for calculating clear-sky irradiance, solar position, and atmospheric conditions. These features were instrumental in building a reliable and data-driven forecasting model.
